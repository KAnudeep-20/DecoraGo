Hey, This is my DecoraGo repository which consists of HTML files of a web page called DecoraGo, which is an event organisation company web web page created by me and my friends to show case our idea in a haackthon
where we can easily contact different type of dealers for distinct services we need during functions, ceremonies, official gatherings and more.
Here, we have used HTML, CSS to build our web page and we have connected two another pages to the main page which is in "index.html" to move from one page to another for different services.
